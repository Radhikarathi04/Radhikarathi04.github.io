                    <h1>👋🏻 Hey, I'm Radhika</h1>

                    <p>💁🏻‍♀️ I'm a Software Engineer working in London, United Kingdom. </p>

                    <p> 🎨 I am an artist who loves to sketch on paper as well as digitally. I express myself through my art in a variety of ways. I've gifted artwork to Former Indian Cricket team Captain and received recognition from companies such as Nestle. </p>
                        
                        <p> 🎓 My first experience of moving out of my native country, let alone a city, has been life-changing. Interacting with students from around the world gave me a chance to learn about other cultures.  Living independently and managing different tasks has strengthened my time management skills and has made me stronger and more resilient. Living alone, however, had its own challenges, which led me to discover different coping mechanisms that I'd like to share with you.</p>

                    

                    <p> ✍🏻 On this website, I will be sharing blogs and illustrations on personal development, growth mindset and self-care. I have also started a club named <strong><em>"Invest in Yourself Club"</em></strong>. I strongly believe the best possible investment you can make is in <em>yourself</em>. A good investment isn't just about money, but also your physical and mental health, sleep, nutrition, and overall well-being to achieve your highest potential and productivity. So let's be friends and grow together.</p>
