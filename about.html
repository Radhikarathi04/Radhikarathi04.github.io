                    <h1>About Me</h1>

                    <p>💁🏻‍♀️ I'm a Software Engineer working in London, United Kingdom.</p>

                    <p>💻 I took a non-traditional path into tech. After completing a coding bootcamp, I joined a graduate scheme and have gained 2+ years of professional experience in software engineering. My journey proves that with dedication and passion, you can transition into tech from any background.</p>

                    <p>🎨 I am an artist who loves to sketch on paper as well as digitally. I express myself through my art in a variety of ways. I've gifted artwork to Former Indian Cricket team Captain and received recognition from companies such as Nestle.</p>
                    
                    <p>🧘‍♀️ Beyond coding and art, I practice yoga and am an avid reader. I believe in maintaining a balanced lifestyle that nurtures both mind and body.</p>
